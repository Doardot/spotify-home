<h1> Spotify Homepage </h1>
<p> This project aims to create a "clone" site of Spotify's homepage. 
  It was successfully carried out during Alura's 5-day Front-End Immersion in February 2024. 
  I used the knowledge acquired in the course and went further, with some features programmed by me.</p>

<p> HTML5, CSS3 and JS were used to build it. The project uses an internal API to get the artists' information.</p>

<h1> Visualization </h1>

<p>There are a few artists, try searching them:
Foo Fighters, Michael Jackson, Emicida, Chitãozinho e Xororó, Mc Coringa, Arlindo Cruz, Caetano Veloso, Manoel Gomes, Maira e Maraisa.</p>

<h1> Features in progress </h1>

<li>Functional music player;</li>
<li>Functional search bar for the site.</li> 
<br>
<p>Today, the search bar becomes functional only if you clone the repository and run a JSON server.
  Try the following command in the terminal: </p>
<p>json-server --watch api-artists/artists.json --port 3000</p>
